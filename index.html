  We're going to guess whether you're logged in to a number of popular sites based
  on how long it takes us to fetch (through a hidden script element) resources
  on that domain. This is a naive implementation of a technique described in the 2009 paper
  "<a href='https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/papers/webtiming.pdf'>Exposing Private Information by Timing Web Applications</a>" (PDF),
  so we don't consider this a novel discovery, though the triviality of this
  implementation and its potential applications are perhaps interesting.
  Refinements to increase the accuracy of the guesses are welcome <a href="https://github.com/eloquence/checkmystatus">through GitHub</a>.
  <p>
  I've found script tags produce more consistent timings across Firefox and Chrome than image tags.
  A reliable defense against this particular implementation is to disable third-party
  cookies in your browser. The script requests will then not send the cookies along
  which tell the sites that you're logged in.
  <p>
  Incidentally, that same mechanism (third-party cookies) is used by advertising networks
  to track your identity across sites, so they're probably a good idea to disable if you care
  about privacy. ;-)
  <p>
  Because desktop and mobile sites often differ dramatically, we use separate configurations
  for those; if you're on a mobile browser, you'll see a smaller set of results.
